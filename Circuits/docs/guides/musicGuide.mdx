# Making a background music player
In this guide, we will teach you how to make a playlist in RecRoom. This guide implies that you know how to use the makerpen, and how to navigate menus. If you don't know how, try the makerpen tutorial at https://rec.net/d/room/CA_Circuits101 . Thise guide also implies that you already have audio in your room from the "Sample Audio" chip. 


First we want to spawn a "list create". Wire the sounds to the "list create". (TIP) Configure the "list create" to add inputs so you can have more items in your list

Now when a player joins the room, there is a playlist of audio playing in the background.
