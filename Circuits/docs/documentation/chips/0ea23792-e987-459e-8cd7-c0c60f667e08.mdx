# Spherecast

Fires an invisible sphere of the specified Radius from the Start Position, in the Direction specified. Returns true if any object or player is hit within the target Max Distance. Otherwise, returns false. You can configure the chip itself to ignore players or objects specifically.

### Uses

None so far!

### Tips

Configuring the chip can allow ignoring players and objects. This means that the ray can move through players or objects based on this configuration. Decoration objects can *not* be detected.

### Issues

The initial sphere around the origin position will ignore all collisions. if you are attempting to find the collisions in this sphere, use an overlap sphere instead.
