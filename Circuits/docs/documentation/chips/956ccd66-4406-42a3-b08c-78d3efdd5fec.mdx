# Angular Velocity Add


Add angular velocity to an object. The Angular Velocity vector should lie along the axis of the rotation being added, with a magnitude that (once multiplied by the speed multiplier) represents the clockwise rotation speed in deg/s. Once the new angular velocity has been computed, its speed will be capped by the Max Angular Speed.
