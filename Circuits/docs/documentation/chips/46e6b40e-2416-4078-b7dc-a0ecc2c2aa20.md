# Prompt Local Player


Sends a watch notification to a player. The player which it sends a notification to depends on who's machine fires the exec pin. Once this watch notification is opened, the player can type responses into the text box and send back responses. You can define the prompt title and the prompt itself via inputs, and can also receive the playerâ€™s response via an output pin.
